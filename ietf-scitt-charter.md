Introduction
============
Over the years rapid technological advancements have motivated organizations to implement efficient processes from design to manufacturing, logisitics and just-in time delivery. While these improvements help organizations increase efficiency and swiftly bring innovations to market, the rapid increase in scale, size and complexity of supply chain have led to more and more sophisticated supply chain attacks. The traditional methods of safeguarding the supply chain (e.g. pre and post audit
methodologies) is no longer adequate.

A minimally, simple and concise set of building blocks could guarantee a long term accountability and inter-operability for supply chain components and their metadata
through their life-cycles across architecturally diverse systems.

Goals
=====
The WG has defined an architecture (link to architecture) for securing a software supply chain. The WG will standardize the overall workflow and essential building blocks that make up the architecture.

The WG will use the existing work already done within other IETF WGs such as 
COSE WG, IETF RATS WG, as appropriate.


Program of Work
===============
The working group will develop standards supporting interoperable supply chain building blocks. The main deliverables are as follows:

1. Identify Supply Chain issuers. Define common identity methods that are verifiable and non repudiable for a given period of time.

2. Define Envelope and Schema for carrying Supply Chain Claims/Endorsements.

3. Standardize the Transparent Registry requirements to generate homogenity across multiple supply chains

4. Supply Chain Receipts : TO DO

5. Supply Chain Auditor: TO DO

6. Notary: TO DO

7. Standardize external API provided to various actors to interact with the Supply Chain Ecosystem. Also standardize inter-component messages between supply chain building blocks.
